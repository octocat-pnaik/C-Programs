Note: Code is tested on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS version - 64-bit operating system
Steps to run the project:
1) Execute the make command.
2) Process Injection Attack using Ptrace System Call
2.1) Open the terminal
2.2) Set the value of ptrace scope in the Linux Yama module to 0, using the following command.
echo 0 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope
2.3) Run target.c using the following command.
./target
2.4) Now open another terminal, and run the processInjection.c using the following command.
./processInjection <%VictimProcessId%>
2.5) After successful execution of processInjection.c, go back to the terminal where the target program is running.
You will be given the shell access to exploit the system resources.
3) Process Injection Attack using LD_PRELOAD environment variable
3.1) Open the terminal
3.2) Run the following command to add the path of the shared library ld-processInjection.so to the LD PRELOAD environment variable.
export LD_PRELOAD=/<%path of folder that contains ld-processInjection.so%>/ld-processInjection.so
3.3) Run the legitimate program called target.c using the below command.
./target
Execution of the target program will provide you the shell access.
